#Make sure when you are coding to close off all parentheses's and brackets so that the code can be read as correct.

#The quotation marks needed to be closed fully around the input function

#The syntax list needs to be changed due to the "if" statments. Also the brackets need to be identical and not faternal other wise
#The code will fail

#The "else" statment is missing from this code. "Elif's" are used for "else if" statments. Meaning if the first condition turned out to be
#false then it rotates to the next elif statment. Over all the elif isn't needed for this code and else will do
